
This repository contain the code used to synthesised an energy-efficient and robust-trained
analog neural network.

In this repo, you will found : 
    In folder "6 - PLS CADENCE" :
        - "CDS_Synthesis" : Automatic cadence schematic network evaluation
        - "Extractor_Utils" : to generate Sigmoid and polynomial model for activation function and synaptic gains
        - "First_extractor" : generate the model for the "IN" neuron
        - "Hidden_extractor" : generate the model for the "HN" neuron
        - "FullExtractor" (the one runned) : generate model for "HN" and "IN" neuron
        - "Network_Reader" : used to see the Cadence PLS results
        - "Network_visualizer" : used to visualize the tensorflow networks with physical sizing
        - "TF_Synthetiser" : the paper proposal framework
        - "Utils" : utils functions used by the code above

    In folder "libs" :
        - Personnal libs used to automaticaly run Cadence from python.
